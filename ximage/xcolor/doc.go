// Package xcolor implements Red, RedGreen, and RGB color models matching the core
// image/color interface.
// 
// Note that there are good reasons these color types aren't in the core
// image.color package. The native color types may have optimized fast-paths
// for many use cases.
// 
// This package is a tradeoff of these optimizations against lower memory
// usage. This package is intended to be used in computer graphics (e.g.
// OpenGL) where images are uploaded to the GPU in a specific format (such as
// GL_R, GL_RG, or GL_RGB) and we don't care about the performance of native
// Go image manipulation.
