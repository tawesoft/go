Package xcolor implements Red, RedGreen, and RGB color models matching the core
image/color interface.

Note that there are good reasons these color types aren't in the core
image.color package. The native color types may have optimized fast-paths
for many use cases.

This package is a tradeoff of these optimizations against lower memory
usage. This package is intended to be used in computer graphics (e.g.
OpenGL) where images are uploaded to the GPU in a specific format (such as
GL_R, GL_RG, or GL_RGB) and we don't care about the performance of native
Go image manipulation.
