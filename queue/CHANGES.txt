    * The Queue RetryItem and DeleteItem methods now take an Item, not an
      ItemID.

    * The Queue RetryItem method now correctly increments the Attempt field
      on disk.

    * Calling the Delete() method on a Queue now attempts to avoid deleting
      an in-memory database opened as ":memory:".
