short-desc: SQL database extras
stable: candidate

---

Package sqlp ("SQL-plus" or "squelp!") defines helpful interfaces and
implements extra features for Go SQL database drivers. Specific driver
extras are implemented in the subdirectories.

Features

* Open a SQLite database with foreign keys, UTF8 collation, etc. made easy
to avoid copy+pasting the same boilerplate into each project.

* "Missing" essentials like escaping an SQL column name
(https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18478) or examining an SQL error for
properties such as IsUniqueConstraintError when inserting duplicate items

* Interfaces like Queryable which is implemented by all of sql.DB, sql.Tx
and sql.Stmt, for performing queries regardless of if they are in a
transaction or not.

Driver extras

* tawesoft.co.uk/go/sqlp/sqlite3 (mattn/go-sqlite3)
