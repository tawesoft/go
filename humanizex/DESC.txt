short-desc: locale-aware natural number formatting
stable: no

---

Package humanizex is an elegant general-purpose, locale-aware way to format
and parse numbers and quantities - like distances, bytes, and time - in a
human-readable way ideal for config files and as a building-block for a fully
translated ergonomic user interface.

If golang.org/x/text is ever promoted to core then there will be a new version
of this package named `humanize` (dropping the 'x').
