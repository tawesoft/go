short-desc: locale-aware natural number formatting

---

Package humanizex is an elegant, general-purpose, extensible, modular,
locale-aware way to format and parse numbers and quantities - like distances,
bytes, and time - in a human-readable way ideal for config files and as a
building-block for fully translated ergonomic user interfaces.

If golang.org/x/text is ever promoted to core then there will be a new version
of this package named `humanize` (dropping the 'x').

What about dustin's go-humanize?

dustin's go-humanize (https://github.com/dustin/go-humanize) is 3.9 to 4.5
times faster formatting and 2 times faster parsing, if this is a bottleneck for
you. It's also quite mature, so is probably very well tested by now. If you're
only targeting the English language it also has more handy "out of the box"
features.

On the other hand, tawesoft's humanizex is more general purpose and has better
localisation support. Even with those extra features, tawesoft's humanizex
codebase is also smaller and simpler.
