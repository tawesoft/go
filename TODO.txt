* Root level license.txt isn't being properly regenerated after porting the
  docs generator from python to go?

* Some links are broken in the static docs e.g.
    - http://localhost:6061/pkg/builtin/#string => https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#string
    - http://localhost:6061/src/tawesoft.co.uk/go/tawesoft.go?m=text => remove entirely
