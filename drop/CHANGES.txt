    * The Inheritable interface has changed. It now has a Close() method. The
      Name() method has also been renamed String() to satisfy the stringer
      interface.

    * The Drop() function now returns an extra value before the error value.
      This `closer` can be used by the child process to close all Inheritable
      handles. Alternatively, it is possible to ignore this and close each
      handle by calling their Close() method.

    * The package now exports the builtins InheritableFile and
      InheritableNetListener that implement the Inheritable interface for
      Files and net.Listeners. These are created by the functions
      NewInheritableFile, NewInheritableTCPListener and
      NewInheritableUnixListener.

    * Drop() no longer panics on non-Linux platforms. However, it has only been
      tested on Linux so YMMV. It will continue to panic on Windows. Listeners
      also cannot be inherited on the JS platform target as they are not backed
      by files.

    * Drop() now returns a (bool, error) 2-tuple. The first return value,
      if true, indicates that the caller should immediately exit.

    * Drop() functionality has been moved to tawesoft.co.uk/go/drop with
      changes to Inheritables from a struct to an interface.
