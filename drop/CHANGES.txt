    * The Inheritable interface now has a Close() method. Implementations will
      need to add this method.

    * The package now exports the builtins InheritableFile and
      InheritableNetListener that implement the Inheritable interface for
      Files and net.Listeners

    * Drop() no longer panics on non-Linux platforms. However, it has only been
      tested on Linux so YMMV.

    * Drop() now returns a (bool, error) 2-tuple. The first return value,
      if true, indicates that the caller should immediately exit.

    * Drop() functionality has been moved to tawesoft.co.uk/go/drop with
      changes to Inheritables from a struct to an interface.
