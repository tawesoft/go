short-desc: drop privileges and inherit handles
stable: candidate

---

Package drop implements the ability to start a process as root, open
privileged resources as files, drop privileges to become a given user account,
and inherit file handles across the dropping of privileges.

NOTE: This package has only been tested on Linux. YMMV.

NOTE: This package WILL NOT WORK on Windows.

WARNING: if a process opens a config file as root, that file must be writable
by root or system accounts only. The safest way to do this is change it to
be root-owned with permissions 0644 (or 0600).
