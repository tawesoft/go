A monorepo for small Go modules maintained by TawesoftÂ®

FROZEN - PLEASE MIGRATE

These packages are moving to https://github.com/tawesoft/golib.

This is to increase security against possible supply chain attacks such as our domain name expiring in the future and being registered by someone else.

Please migrate to https://github.com/tawesoft/golib (when available) instead.

Most programs relying on a package in this monorepo, such as the dialog or lxstrconv packages, will continue to work for the foreseeable future.

Rarely used packages have been hidden for now - they are in the git commit history at https://github.com/tawesoft/go if you need to resurrect one.
