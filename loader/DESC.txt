short-desc: concurrent dependency graph solver
stable: candidate

---

Package loader implements the ability to define a graph of tasks and
dependencies, classes of synchronous and concurrent workers, and limiting
strategies, and solve the graph incrementally or totally.

For example, this could be used to implement a loading screen for a computer
game with a progress bar that updates in real time, with images being decoded
concurrently with files being loaded from disk, and synchronised with the main
thread for safe OpenGL operations such as creating texture objects on the GPU.

Examples

EXAMPLE: limit-connections-per-host
