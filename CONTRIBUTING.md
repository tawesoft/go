Code contributions
------------------

If your contribution is anything less trivial than correcting a spelling
mistake or formatting, then you deserve credit - so please insert a line
under the existing authors in COPYING.txt giving yourself attribution! If 
you don't, it's assumed you are happy for your contribution to fall under
the existing license and for the git history to serve as credit. Credit can 
be added to COPYING.txt after-the-fact but won't be legally binding on earlier
commits. Email addresses in COPYING.txt may be removed if domains expire and 
are not required.

Coding Standards
----------------

Use en-US for code, en-GB for comments, please.

We use spaces instead of tabs here. Sorry!
