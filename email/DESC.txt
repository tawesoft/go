---

Package email implements the formatting of multipart MIME e-mail messages,
including Unicode headers, attachments, HTML email, and plain text.

File attachments are lazy, and read from disk only at the time the e-mail is
sent.

(Optionally) supports encoding very long headers using folding whitespace.

Examples

EXAMPLE: stdout
