---

Package log provides a common way to quickly configure a logging implementation
with file rotation, syslog, console output, etc. for some popular logging
implementations such as zerolog.

This package defines the configuration interface, which is json-encodable.

Loggers are concretely implemented by the packages in the subfolder e.g.
tawesoft.co.uk/go/log/zerolog.

The package also wraps the stdlib syslog as an interface without it being a
compile-time constraint so that it can be imported on platforms that don't
support syslog (like Windows), giving a runtime error if used instead.
