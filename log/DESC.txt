---

Package log provides a common way to quickly configure a logging implementation
with file rotation, syslog, console output, etc. for some popular logging
implementations such as zerolog.

This package defines the configuration interface. It is concretely
implemented by the packages in the subfolder.

The package also wraps the stdlib syslog as an interface without it being a
compile-time constraint so that it can be imported on platforms that don't
support syslog (like Windows), but give a runtime error instead.
