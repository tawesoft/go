---

Package router is a general purpose router of methods (e.g. HTTP "GET") and
paths (e.g. "/user/123/profile") to some value e.g. a controller.

Supports named routes, route parameters, constructing a path from a route,
pattern submatches, etc.

Although built with HTTP routing in mind, this is a general purpose
implementation that can route to any type of value - it is not limited to
HTTP handlers.
